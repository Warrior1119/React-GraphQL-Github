### Here are possible enhancements if I had more time:
1. Write unit test for each components and graphql api
2. Add more functionalities like sort by
3. UI improvement with more styling
4. Bug fix - loading more has some bugs that it loads same repositories twice some times. Looks like sort issue of graphql from the server and needs more time to do debug.
